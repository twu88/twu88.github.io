I am currently serving as the Lead Cyber Researcher at Ofgem, where I drive cybersecurity initiatives and research to ensure the security and resilience of critical infrastructure. My professional journey has been rooted in both academic research and practical cybersecurity applications, with a focus on cutting-edge techniques and methodologies.

Before joining Ofgem, I held a position as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Plymouth, where I contributed to the Cyber SHIP project. This initiative involved penetration testing from a research perspective, focusing on maritime systems' vulnerabilities and how they can be addressed to enhance security in the shipping industry.

I completed my PhD in Cyber Security at the University of Oxford in 2021, where I undertook advanced training in cyber security, focusing on innovative approaches to tackling emerging cyber threats. My doctoral research provided deep insights into system vulnerabilities and the methodologies used to assess and mitigate risks in complex systems.

With a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied cybersecurity, I am passionate about advancing the field and driving impactful research and development to address real-world challenges in the ever-evolving digital landscape.
